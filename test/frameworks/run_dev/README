You must create a local.txt file in this directory with the properties that
would be set in a dev cache's local.txt.

You will probably want at least these:

org.lockss.platform.diskSpacePaths=./cache
org.lockss.platform.localIPAddress=<routable-IP-address>
org.lockss.platform.localIPs=<routable-IP-address>
org.lockss.platform.accesssubnet=<local subnet>
org.lockss.platform.smtphost=<smtp-host>
