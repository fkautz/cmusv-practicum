run_dev runs a development daemon that mimics a production daemon,
downloading global config from a prop server.  You must create a local.txt
file in this directory with the essential machine config properties that
would be set in a real LOCKSS box's local.txt.

You will probably want at least these:

org.lockss.platform.diskSpacePaths=./cache
org.lockss.platform.localIPAddress=<IP-address>
org.lockss.platform.accesssubnet=<local-subnet>
org.lockss.platform.v3.identity=TCP:[<IP-address>]:9729

You may want:

org.lockss.platform.fqdn=<fqdn>>
org.lockss.platform.smtphost=<smtp-host>
org.lockss.platform.sysadminemail=<email-addr>


To run:
  cd test/frameworks/run_dev
  ./start -p <prop-url>
  ...   (connect to daemon on port 8081)
  ./stop
