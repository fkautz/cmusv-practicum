run_multiple_daemons runs four daemon instances on one machine.  Useful to
test polling.  By default, the first instance calls polls on whatever it
has collected, inviting the other three instances to vote.

To run:
  cd test/frameworks/run_multiple_daemons
  ./start
  ...   (connect to daemon on port 8081, 8082, 8083, 8084)
  ./stop
