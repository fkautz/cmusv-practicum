run_one_daemon runs a standalone development daemon.  Useful for testing
basic daemon behavior through the UI, and crawling behavior of plugins
(crawl fules, URL normalizers, etc.).

To run:
  cd test/frameworks/run_one_daemon
  ./start
  ...   (connect to daemon on port 8081)
  ./stop

To test a new plugin, put it in the appropriate package dir in the
toplevel plugins/ tree, add its name to org.lockss.plugin.registry (in
common.xml), "ant jar-plugins" then start the daemon.
