run_one_daemon runs a standalone development daemon.  Useful for testing
basic daemon behavior through the UI, and crawling behavior of plugins
(crawl rules, URL normalizers, etc.).

To run:
  cd test/frameworks/run_one_daemon
  ./start
  ...   (connect to daemon UI at http://localhost:8081/
         user=test, passwd=test)
  ./stop

See test.out for errors and other messages.

UI access is initially allowed from localhost (127.0.0.1).  For access
from other hosts either use a browser on localhost or add the line
  org.lockss.ui.access.ip.include=<ip-address-or-subnet>
to ./lockss.txt .  E.g.,
  org.lockss.ui.access.ip.include=192.168.10.0/24

To test a new plugin, put it in the appropriate package dir in the
toplevel plugins/ tree, add its name to org.lockss.plugin.registry (in
common.xml), "ant jar-plugins" then start the daemon.
