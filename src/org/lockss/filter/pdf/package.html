 <body>

  <p>Provides filtering and normalization frameworks for PDF data.</p>

  <p>The underlying implementation relies on PDFBox, a PDF library for
  Java released under the BSD license. Though not all possible
  features are implemented by PDFBox, the PDF version supported is
  PDF 1.6 (PDF Reference, Fifth Edition).</p>

  <p>Three classes in the {@link org.lockss.util} package are used to
  provide useful abstractions and utilities to clients of this
  package: {@link org.lockss.util.PdfDocument},
  {@link org.lockss.util.PdfPage} and
  {@link org.lockss.util.PdfUtil}.</p>

  <h2>The PDF transform framework</h2>

  <p>The PDF transform framework provides an API for the
  transformation of PDF documents, via a
  {@link org.lockss.util.PdfDocument} instance. The driving
  interface in this framework is
  {@link org.lockss.filter.pdf.PdfTransform}, with basic
  implementations such as
  {@link org.lockss.filter.pdf.CompoundPdfTransform},
  {@link org.lockss.filter.pdf.ConditionalPdfTransform} or
  {@link org.lockss.filter.pdf.TransformSelectedPages}.</p>

  <h2>The PDF page transform framework</h2>

  <p>The PDF page transform framework provides an API for the
  transformation of PDF pages, via a {@link org.lockss.util.PdfPage}
  instance. The driving interface in this framework is
  {@link org.lockss.filter.pdf.PdfPageTransform}, with basic
  implementations such as
  {@link org.lockss.filter.pdf.CompoundPdfPageTransform},
  {@link org.lockss.filter.pdf.ConditionalPdfPageTransform} or
  {@link org.lockss.filter.pdf.PdfPageStreamTransform}.</p>

  <h2>The PDF page stream transform framework</h2>

  <p>The PDF page stream transform framework is an extension to
  PDFBox's PDF stream engine facility, which processes the token
  streams of PDF pages using PDF operator processors. PDFBox's
  {@link org.pdfbox.util.PDFStreamEngine} and
  {@link org.pdfbox.util.PDFOperator} are extended respectively to
  {@link org.lockss.filter.pdf.PdfPageStreamTransform} and
  {@link org.lockss.filter.pdf.PdfOperatorProcessor}. The default
  PDF operator processor used by
  {@link org.lockss.filter.pdf.PdfPageStreamTransform} is
  {@link org.lockss.filter.pdf.SimpleOperatorProcessor}.</p>
