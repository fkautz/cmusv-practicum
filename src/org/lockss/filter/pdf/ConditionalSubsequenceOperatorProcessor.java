/**
 * <p>A conditional operator processor that examines a fixed-length
 * subsequence from the end of the current output list and
 * conditionally acts on it.</p>
 * <p>This operator processor is useful when only a fixed-length
 * portion of the end of the output list is sufficient to determine
 * a condition, or at least if there is a safe upper bound on the
 * number of tokens drawn from the end of the output list are
 * needed to determine the condition.</p>
 * <p>In summary, the behavior of this class is as follows:</p>
 * <ul>
 *  <li>{@link #getSequence} returns the last
 *  <code>getSubsequenceLength()</code> tokens from the output list
 *  (or the whole output list if fewer than the required number of
 *  tokens are in it).</li>
 *  <li>{@link #processIdentified} replaces the last
 *  {@link #getSubsequenceLength} tokens from the output list by the
 *  result of {@link #getReplacement}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>The {@link #processIdentified} method assumes that the number of
 * tokens to remove from the end of the output list (to be replaced by
 * tokens computed by {@link #getReplacement}) is indeed exactly
 * <code>getSubsequenceLength()</code>. If this operator processor's
 * {@link ConditionalOperatorProcessor#identify} method omits to check
 * so and signals it recognizes the tokens, indices can become out of
 * bounds.</p>
 * <p>Subclasses can have state between a successful call to
 * {@link ConditionalOperatorProcessor#identify} and the subsequent
 * call to {@link #getReplacement} by using instance variables, as
 * long as they override
 * {@link PdfOperatorProcessor#process(PageStreamTransform, PDFOperator, List)}
 * as follows:</p>
<pre>
  public synchronized void process(PageStreamTransform pageStreamTransform,

                                   List operands)
      throws IOException {
    super.process(pageStreamTransform, operator, operands);
  }
</pre>
 * <p>{@link ConditionalSubsequenceOperatorProcessor} instances, like
 * {@link ConditionalOperatorProcessor} instances, <em>must</em> have a
 * no-argument constructor, and are instantiated once per key
 * associated with their class name during a given
 * {@link PageStreamTransform} instantiation.</p>
