/**
 * <p>A conditional operator processor that conditionally merges the
 * output list of the page stream transform being applied, based on
 * the contents of the current output list.</p>
 * <p>This operator processor is to be associated with operators,
 * typically no-operand operators such as "end text object", that end
 * the accumulation of tokens into a sublist. It will usually be
 * paired with an unconditional split (see
 * {@link SplitOperatorProcessor}) or a conditional split.</p>
 * <p>In summary, the behavior of this class is as follows:</p>
 * <ul>
 *  <li>{@link #processIdentified} merges the result of
 *  {@link #getReplacement}.</li>
 *  <li>{@link #processNotIdentified} simply merges.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>Subclasses can have state between a successful call to
 * {@link ConditionalOperatorProcessor#identify} and the subsequent
 * call to {@link #getReplacement} by using instance variables, as
 * long as they override
 * {@link PdfOperatorProcessor#process(PageStreamTransform, PDFOperator, List)}
 * as follows:</p>
<pre>
  public synchronized void process(PageStreamTransform pageStreamTransform,
                                   PDFOperator operator,
                                   List operands)
      throws IOException {
    super.process(pageStreamTransform, operator, operands);
  }
</pre>
 * <p>{@link ConditionalMergeOperatorProcessor} instances, like
 * {@link ConditionalOperatorProcessor} instances, <em>must</em> have a
 * no-argument constructor, and are instantiated once per key
 * associated with their class name during a given
 * {@link PageStreamTransform} instantiation.</p>
