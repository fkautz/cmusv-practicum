/**
 * <p>A PDF stream engine (PDF token stream processor) written as a
 * PDF page transform and based on {@link PdfOperatorProcessor}
 * rather than {@link OperatorProcessor}.</p>
 * <p>A PDF page stream transform iterates through a PDF page's token
 * stream, calls a PDF operator processor for each operator
 * encountered, and builds a transformed list of tokens (based on
 * actions taken by the operator processors). The PDF page stream
 * transform is configured using a {@link Properties} object which
 * maps PDF operator strings from {@link PdfUtil#getPdfOperators} to
 * the string name of a PDF operator processor class to use when the
 * operator is encountered. Any such PDF operator string not mapped
 * to a class name string in the {@link Properties} instance used to
 * configure the PDF page stream transform at instantiation will be
 * processed by default by {@link SimpleOperatorProcessor}, which
 * just adds its operands and operator unchanged to the output
 * list.</p>
 * <p>The PDF page stream transform maintains a stack of output lists
 * rather than a single output list. However, when {@link #transform}
 * ends it <em>must</em> be the case that the result of all the
 * operations of the PDF operator processors are such that there is
 * only one output list on the stack, or a
 * {@link PageTransformException} will be thrown. This remaining
 * list is used as the result to rewrite the token stream of the PDF
 * page, if any PDF operator processor has indicated to the transform
 * that it has enacted any change in the output list compared to the
 * original token stream by calling {@link #signalChange} (otherwise
 * the PDF page is unchanged).</p>
 * <p>The equivalent of {@link Stack#peek} is {@link #getOutputList}
 * which is used by PDF operator processors to obtain the current
 * output list, to which they can add tokens. To cause a new, empty
 * list to be pushed onto the stack (akin to {@link Stack#push}),
 * PDF operator processors call {@link #splitOutputList}. Splitting
 * from the list currently on top of the stack is useful to introduce
 * a subpart of the token stream, for example to bracket a subpart
 * from an opening marker up to some closing marker. Typically this
 * is used to isolate
 * {@link PdfUtil#BEGIN_TEXT_OBJECT}/{@link PdfUtil#END_TEXT_OBJECT}
 * blocks.</p>
 * <p>A PDF operator processor can decide to attach the list currently
 * at the top of the stack to the end of the list underneath (a kind
 * of {@link Stack#pop} operation called "merge"). If
 * {@link #mergeOutputList()} is called, the list currently at the top
 * of the stack is added to the end of the list underneath, and the
 * result becomes the new top of the list stack. If
 * {@link #mergeOutputList(List)} is called, the replacement list is
 * used instead of the current top of the stack, which is discarded.
 * This is useful to provide a transformed result for an entire
 * subpart of the stream previously isolated with a split.</p>
 * <p>{@link PdfOperatorProcessor} instances, like
 * {@link OperatorProcessor} instances, <em>must</em> have a
 * no-argument constructor, and are instantiated once per key
 * associated with their class name during a given
 * {@link PageStreamTransform} instantiation.</p>
