/**
 * <p>A PDF operator processor that unconditionally splits the output
 * list of the PDF page stream transform being applied, then simply
 * passes its operands and operator into the output sublist
 * unconditionally.</p>
 * <p>This operator processor is to be associated with operators,
 * typically no-operand operators such as "begin text object"
 * (<code>BT</code>), that start sublists and accumulate content up
 * until some end condition, typically an end marker such as "end
 * text object" (<code>ET</code>). The matching end condition will
 * then need to merge the output sublist, or split/merge mismatches will
 * occur.</p>
 * <p>For example, this operator processor could be associated with
 * "begin text object", and the operator processor for "end text
 * object" could merge with or without replacement based on a
 * condition derived from the contents of the output sublist.</p>
 * <p>{@link SplitOperatorProcessor} instances, like
 * {@link PdfOperatorProcessor} instances, <em>must</em> have a
 * no-argument constructor, and are instantiated once per key
 * associated with their class name during a given
 * {@link PageStreamTransform} instantiation.</p>
