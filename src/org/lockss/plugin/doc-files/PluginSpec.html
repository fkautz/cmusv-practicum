<h1>LOCKSS: Plugin Specification</h1>
</div>

<h3>David S. H. Rosenthal</h3>

<h3>Draft 4/3/03</h3>
</div>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The LOCKSS daemon must be adapted to a new journal publishing
platform by means of a ``plugin'',
a set of Java classes implementing certain functions.
This document introduces the specification for this ``plugin''.
The audience is publishers and developers of plugins.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The LOCKSS system handles the content it preserves in chunks called 
"Archival Units" (or AUs).
In most cases for electronic journals this will be a volume.
Each AU is configured with a plugin,
a set of Java classes that provide all its journal-specific functions,
and whatever information is needed to specify the volume or other chunk of
content it is preserving.</p>

<p>The LOCKSS daemon is configured with a list of sources of plugins,
which may be the local disk or HTTP servers on the network.
It loads the set of plugins it needs,
based on the configuration information stored for each AU in its disks.</p>

<p>This specification is aimed primarily at the developers of plugins.
It is preliminary and subject to change.
In particular,
we hope to provide a more generic example plugin and more detail on
the APIs that the plugin implementors can use to get started.
</p>

<p>It is important that the developers of plugins for LOCKSS make
them available under an Open Source license.
It is effectively impossible for a library to have confidence in an
archive whose source code is proprietary and secret.
It will be hard to develop a broad enough base of plugins to cover
the variety of journals libraries wish to preserve without the
sharing of techniques and code examples that Open Source allows.
</p>

<h2>Plugin Functions</h2>

<p>A LOCKSS plugin must provide the following functions:</p>

<ol>

<li><i>How to access the publisher.</i>
It must be able to connect to the publisher's web site
and fetch URLs for caching or repairing,
including providing any authentication that may be needed.
Some sites use IP address authentication,
others require passwords for basic or site-specific authentication.</li>

<li><i>When to crawl.</i>
It must know when to expect new content to appear on the journal web site,
so that the daemon can collect it promptly,
and can determine the rate at which it should be audited.</li>

<li><i>What crawl parameters to use.</i>
It must know the correct crawl parameters to use for the publisher's web site.
These include a set of limitiations negotiated with the publisher to
reduce the impact of the LOCKSS caches,
for example periods when crawling is not permitted,
the maximum hit rate allowed,
etc.</li>

<li><i>Where to start crawling.</i>
It must know how to find and interpret the LOCKSS-specific <i>volume index page</i>
which gives the daemon permission to crawl the site and provides the set of
initial URLs at which to start the process.</li>

<li><i>Where to stop crawling.</i>
It must know where the boundaries of the,
so as to distinguish those intra-AU links that the crawl should follow,
and those links that point outside the AU,
and thus should not be followed.</li>

<li><i>How to recognize crawl errors.</i>
It must know how to distinguish between success and failure when fetching a URL.
Some journals use HTTP response codes to indicate failure,
others supply more user-friendly but less easily recognized pages without a response code.</li>

<li><i>What to audit.</i>
It must know how to distinguish between the permanent parts of the content returned,
and the evanescent parts such as advertisements and personalizations.
The audit that detects differences between the same file at different caches must
eliminate the evanescent parts and compare only the permanent parts.</li>

<li><i>Configure an Archival Unit.</i>
It must know which configuration information is needed to specify one of the AUs which
it is capable of preserving.
The daemon's user interface needs to know this in order to ask the administrator
the appropriate questions during journal and AU configuration.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Plugin Interfaces</h2>

<p>A plugin consists of a <i>.jar</i> file implementing the following interfaces:

<ol>
<li><a href="../../plugin/Plugin.html">org.lockss.plugin.Plugin</a></li>
<li><a href="../../plugin/ArchivalUnit.html">org.lockss.plugin.ArchivalUnit</a></li>
<li><a href="../../daemon/CrawlRule.html">org.lockss.daemon.CrawlRule</a></li>
<li><a href="../../plugin/UrlCacher.html">org.lockss.plugin.UrlCacher</a></li>
<li><a href="../../plugin/CachedUrlSetNode.html">org.lockss.plugin.CachedUrlSetNode</a></li>
<li><a href="../../plugin/CachedUrl.html">org.lockss.plugin.CachedUrl</a></li>
<li><a href="../../plugin/CachedUrlSet.html">org.lockss.plugin.CachedUrlSet</a></li>
</ol>

<h3><a href="../../plugin/Plugin.html">org.lockss.plugin.Plugin</a></h3>

<p>
This is the interface that allows the daemon to manage the plugin and access the
resources it is controlling. 
The important methods it must implement are:</p>
<ol>
<li>A no-argument constructor.</li>
<li><i>createAU()</i> which returns a newly-created <i>ArchivalUnit</i>
based on the configuration information provided.</li>
<li><i>getAU()</i> which returns an existing <i>ArchivalUnit</i> found from its
string identifier provided.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a href="../../plugin/ArchivalUnit.html">org.lockss.plugin.ArchivalUnit</a></h3>

<p>
This is the interface shared by every class representing a unit of preserved content.
It provides methods allowing the daemon to create and access individual pages of
presered content,
and methods allowing the daemon to schedule and perform crawls of the site being
preserved.
The important methods it must implement are:</p>

<ol>
<li><i>getAUId()</i> which returns a <i>String</i> identifying the AU.</li>
<li><i>getAUCachedUrlSet()</i> which returns a <i>CachedUrlSet</i>
representing the entire contents of the AU.</li>
<li><i>makeCachedUrlSet()</i> which returns a <i>CachedUrlSet</i> based on
a URL and a range representing that part of the contents of the AU.</li>
<li><i>getCrawlSpec()</i> which returns a <i>CrawlSpec</i> instructing the
crawler how to crawl the web site being preserved.</li>
<li><i>shouldBeCached()</i>,
a predicate that is true if the URL provided is within the AU's <i>CrawlSpec</i>.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a href="../../daemon/CrawlRule.html">org.lockss.daemon.CrawlRule</a></h3>

<p>
This interface allows the plugin to provide suitable rules for matching URLs against
the <i>CrawlSpec</i> of the AU.
Only one method must be implemented: </p>

<ol>
<li><i>match()</i> which returns <i>INCLUDE</i>,
<i>EXCLUDE</i> or <i>IGNORE</i> according to whether the supplied URL
should be included,
excluded or ignored by this crawl rule.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a href="../../plugin/UrlCacher.html">org.lockss.plugin.UrlCacher</a></h3>

<p>
This interface allows the daemon to store the content of an individual URL,
and access metadata about it.
The imortant methods to be implemented are:
</p>

<ol>
<li>A static method taking a <i>String</i> URL and returning an object implementing the interface.</li>
<li><i>cache()</i> copies the content from the web site being preserved into the repository.</li>
<li><i>getCachedUrl()</i> returns a <i>CachedUrl</i> representing the stored content.</li>
<li><i>getCachedUrlSet()</i> returns the <i>CachedUrlSet</i> in which the stored content resides.</li>
<li><i>getUrl()</i> returns the URL the stored content represents.</li>
<li><i>shouldBeCached()</i> is a predicate which is true if the plugin believes this URL should be preserved.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a href="../../plugin/CachedUrlSetNode.html">org.lockss.plugin.CachedUrlSetNode</a></h3>

<p>
This is a superclass interface,
needed because methods need to return either a single <i>CachedUrl</i> or a <i>CachedUrlSet</i>
representing a list of URLs.
The methods common to both are: </p>

<ol>
<li><i>getType()</i> returns either <i>TYPE_CACHED_URL</i> or <i>TYPE_CACHED_URL_SET</i></li>
<li><i>getUrl()</i> returns the URL of this node.</li>
<li><i>hasContent()</i> is a predicate which is true if this node has content.</li>
<li><i>isLeaf()</i> is a predicate which is true if this node has no descendant.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a href="../../plugin/CachedUrl.html">org.lockss.plugin.CachedUrl</a></h3>

<p>
This interface inherits from <i>CachedUrlSetNode</i> and implements the methods needed
to represent a single preserved URL.
The important methods to be implemented are:
</p>

<ol>
<li><i>openForHashing()</i> returns an <i>InputStream</i> suitable for hashing the content.</li>
<li><i>openForReading()</i> returns an <i>InputStream</i> suitable for reading the content.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a href="../../plugin/CachedUrlSet.html">org.lockss.plugin.CachedUrlSet</a></h3>

<p>
This interface inherits from <i>CachedUrlSetNode</i> and implements the methods needed
to represent a set of preserved URLs.
The important methods to be implemented are:
</p>

<ol>
<li><i>containsUrl()</i> is a predicate which is true if the supplied URL matches an entry in the set.</li>
<li><i>flatSetIterator()</i> returns an <i>Iterator</i> of <i>CachedUrlSetNode</i> objects
representing the direct descendants of this <i>CachedUrlSet</i>.</li>
<li><i>getContentHasher()</i>
returns an object that can be used to hash the content of cached
urls that match the list of <i>CachedUrlSetSpec</i> entries.</li>
<li><i>getNameHasher()</i> returns an object that can be used to hash the names of cached
urls that match the list of <i>CachedUrlSetSpec</i> entries.</li>
<li><i>getSpec()</i> returns the <i>CachedUrlSetSpec</i> describing the set of URLs that
are members of this <i>CachedUrlSet</i>.
<li><i>makeCachedUrl()</i> Create a <i>CachedUrl</i> object within the set.</li>
<li><i>makeUrlCacher()</i> Create a <i>UrlCacher</i> object within the set.</li>
<li><i>treeIterator()</i> Return an <i>Iterator</i> of <i>CachedUrlSetNode</i> objects
representing all the nodes of the tree rooted at this <i>CachedUrlSet</i>.</li>
</ol>

<h2>API for plugin implementations</h2>

<p>The classes the plugin implementor should subclass are in org.lockss.plugin.base.
They include:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="../../plugin/base/BasePlugin.html">org.lockss.plugin.base.BasePlugin</a>, which is the abstract base class for <i>Plugin</i>.</li>
<li><a href="../../plugin/base/BaseArchivalUnit.html">org.lockss.plugin.base.BaseArchivalUnit.html</a>, which provides an abstract base class for <i>ArchivalUnit</i>.</li>

<li><a href="../../plugin/base/BaseUrlCacher.html">org.lockss.plugin.base.BaseUrlCacher.html</a>, whih provides an abstract base class for <i>UrlCacher</i>.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Example plugin</h2>

<p>An example Plugin is available in org.lockss.plugin.highwire.  It supports the HighWire publishing platform.  A more generic
example Plugin will be provided shortly.</p>

<p>The classes forming the HighWire plugin are:</p>
