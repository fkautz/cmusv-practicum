/**
 * This is a utility class intended to provide some measure of whether a 
 * particular ordering of TdbAu objects, based on either year or volume fields,
 * provides an appropriately consistent ordering for both fields.
 * The main purpose is to decide which ordering gives the most consistent (and 
 * therefore, we assume, more likely to be correct) results. To decide this
 * we need to know which field was used to order the list. There are two ways
 * of assessing the ordering - looking at the consistency of the whole list,
 * and at the consistency of individual ranges that have been created by 
 * identifying coverage gaps in that list.
 * <p>
 * When a list of AUs is ordered in a supposedly chronological order, we expect
 * that the years will be monotonically increasing. This is unfortunately not 
 * always the case, so we have to provide a more flexible metric which allows 
 * them to overlap slightly. We also expect that the volume sequence should 
 * increase, but this assumption is routinely broken because volume identifier 
 * formats change or reset, or sometimes are inconsistently mixed.
 * <p>
 * Volume is the preferred field to inform the calculation of coverage gaps,
 * because there should be no duplication and in general the values should be
 * increasing, and it should therefore be simpler to identify whether or not a 
 * sequence is unbroken. However because of the inconsistencies mentioned above, 
 * it is sometimes necessary to fall back on the year sequence to validate the 
 * coverage gaps suggested by the volume ordering. When the volume ordering 
 * looks particularly suspicious/inconsistent, the list of AUs can be reordered
 * by year to see if that gives a more consistent ordering and set of coverage 
 * ranges. 
 * 
 * <h2>Volume/Year Sequence Consistency</h2>
 * 
 * A volume sequence is consistent if, over each range defined by the 
 * ordered year sequence, each volume identifier is an increment of the 
 * previous one (this gets harder to assess for string-based volumes, 
 * but sequences which are numerical and consecutive will get a high score).
 * <p>
 * A year sequence is consistent if, over each range defined by the 
 * ordered volume sequence, each start date is greater than or equal to the 
 * previous start date <b><i>or</i></b> the start of the first range is 
 * is included in the second range (i.e. there is some kind of overlap).
 * <p>
 * We don't mind if consecutive years are the same; they can also exhibit 
 * breaks within a coverage period as long as the volumes are consecutive and 
 * the years are increasing. This allows for the fact that there may be 
 * legitimate gaps between consecutive volumes of greater than a year,
 * and also that multiple volumes may get published within a single year.
 * 
 * <h2>Summary</h2>
 * 
 * There are methods for checking the strict consecutivity of both years and 
 * volumes represented as integers or strings; for checking whether values are 
 * increasing or decreasing; and whether pairs of years or volumes appear to be 
 * <i>appropriately consecutive</i> (i.e. are close enough to be considered 
 * consecutive if the other field suggests so) or <i>appropriately sequenced</i>
 * (i.e. not causing concern that the AU ordering is deficient).
 * The concept of "appropriate consecutivity" only really applies to years; if
 * volumes cannot be recognised as strictly consecutive, it is safer to record 
 * a coverage gap.
 * <p>
 * Finally there are methods which bring all these measures together in order
 * to produce a measure of consistency for a list of years or volumes which is
 * the outcome of a particular ordering. These are based on the concepts of
 * (a) how many breaks are in a range and whether they are positive or negative 
 * breaks; (b) how much redundancy is in a range; (c) the frequency of coverage 
 * gaps produced by an ordering. The definitions of these concepts differ for 
 * year and volume, and depending on the ordering context.
