Exporter converting metadata to the KBART format.
</p>
<p> 
The <a href="http://www.uksg.org/kbart/s1/summary">KBART recommendations</a> define an ordinal list of 
fields which must all appear in the output. Given that our data is incomplete and entire fields can be empty, 
and the fact in some applications a pared-down or restructured version of the data is more useful, 
certain methods of customising the output have been included. 
Though these do not produce a strict KBART output format, the contents of the fields are KBART compatible. 
</p>
<p> 
We have an entry in <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/kbartregistry/#TOC-LOCKSS">the KBART registry</a> 
which should be kept up to date.
