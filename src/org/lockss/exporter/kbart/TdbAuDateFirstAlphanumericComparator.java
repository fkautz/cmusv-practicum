/**
 * Sort a set of <code>TdbAu</code> objects from a single title into a pseudo-chronological 
 * order based on dates and names. There is no guaranteed way to order chronologically due 
 * to the incompleteness of date metadata included in AUs at the time of writing; however 
 * the naming convention of AUs provides a best-guess alternative method.
 * <p>
 * First an attempt is made to order by any available date information. If the date is supplied
 * as a range, the last year of the range is used for comparison. If that yields no difference,
 * the first years of each range are compared. By convention of TDB AU 
 * naming, ascending alphanumerical order should also be chronological order within a title, so 
 * this is tried second. Note that in general the AU names are identical to the title name plus 
 * a volume or year identifier. However if a title's title/name changes during its run, multiple 
 * titles can appear in the AU records. This is probably wrong as the new title should get a 
 * different ISSN and have a separate title record.
 * <p>
 * Perhaps this comparator should throw an exception if the conventions appear to be 
 * contravened, rather than trying to order with arbitrary names.
 * <p>
 * Note that this comparator should happily sort AUs which have either single years or year ranges 
 * as their date info. However it will produce undefined results if any of the supposedly consecutive
 * year ranges exhibit containment of one another.
