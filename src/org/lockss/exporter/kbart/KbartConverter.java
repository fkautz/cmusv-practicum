/**
 * This class takes metadata in the internal TDB format, and converts it into
 * a format adhering to the KBART recommendations. It extracts the relevant 
 * metadata from internal structures to provide tuples of data suitable for 
 * KBART records. The KBART format focuses at the level of the <emph>title</emph>, 
 * and so the output is made available as <code>KbartTitle</code> objects via an 
 * ordered <code>List</code>. 
 * <p>
 * Note that it is possible to have several <code>KbartTitle</code>
 * objects in a single Publisher which have the same publication title;
 * for example if there are coverage gaps in the license to a particular publication, 
 * there will be a title representing each distinct licensed period (see 5.3.1.9).
 * <p>
 * KBART suggests (5.3.1.11) that the metadata file should be supplied in alphabetical order by 
 * <emph>title</emph>. This requires an overview of all titles before the order can be established,
 * whereas the TDB structure is naturally set up to allow iteration by publisher, it being  
 * a higher element in the hierarchy.
 * <p>
 * Despite this, the class is currently implemented to convert TDB data only when requested.
 * This means that if the class or one of its methods is used multiple times, there will be a 
 * duplication of effort. To overcome this, if a class instance is likely to be reused, a
 * thread-safe lazy loading approach could be implemented. On the other hand, if instantiation seems 
 * like too much work, the whole class could be made static and each method could take a TDB argument. 
 * <p>
 * There is some justification for recording summary statistics about the KbartTitles as they are 
 * created, for example, what the longest field value is, or which fields are universally empty.
 * This can be used to inform layout in outputs that wish to customise the KBART representation.
 * To do this we could pass all field-setting calls through an exporter-specific summariser. 
 * <p>
 * Note that if the underlying <code>Tdb</code> objects are changed during iteration the resulting 
 * output is undefined.
 * <p>
 * <emph>Note that the <code>title_id</code> and <code>title_url</code> fields are currently left 
 * empty as the data we have for these is incomplete or inappropriate.</emph>
