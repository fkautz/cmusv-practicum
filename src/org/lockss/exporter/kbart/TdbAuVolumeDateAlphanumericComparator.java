/**
 * Sort a set of <code>TdbAu</code> objects from a single title into a pseudo-chronological 
 * order based on volumes, dates and names. There is no guaranteed way to order chronologically due 
 * to the incompleteness of volume and date metadata included in AUs at the time of writing; however 
 * the naming convention of AUs provides a best-guess alternative method.
 * <p>
 * First an attempt is made to order by any available volume information. If the volumes are 
 * non-numerical, the comparator attempts to order by years. By convention of TDB AU naming, 
 * ascending alphanumerical name order should also be chronological order within a title, so 
 * this is tried last. Note that in general the AU names are identical to the title name plus 
 * a volume or year identifier. However if a title's title/name changes during its run, multiple 
 * titles can appear in the AU records. This is probably wrong as the new title should get a 
 * different ISSN and have a separate title record.
 * <p>
 * Perhaps this comparator should throw an exception if the conventions appear to be 
 * contravened, rather than trying to order with arbitrary names.
