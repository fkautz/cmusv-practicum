/**
 * Sort a set of <code>TdbAu</code> objects from a single title into a pseudo-chronological 
 * order based on volumes, dates and names. There is no guaranteed way to order chronologically due 
 * to the incompleteness of volume and date metadata included in AUs at the time of writing; however 
 * the naming convention of AUs provides a best-guess alternative method.
 * <p>
 * First an attempt is made to order by any available volume information. If the volumes are 
 * non-numerical, the comparator falls back to the superclass, which attempts to order by years 
 * (in the case of a range, last years then first years), and then finally alphanumerically.
