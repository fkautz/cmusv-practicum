/**
 * <p>An implementation of {@link org.lockss.util.ObjectSerializer}
 * based on
 * {@link <a href="http://www.castor.org/">Castor</a>}.</p>
 * <p>Castor is a very powerful data binding framework, but its focus
 * is relational database persistence rather than lightweight object
 * serialization. A consequence is that Castor requires heavy lifting
 * on the part of client code. Because of the need for mapping files,
 * subtle bugs (as of this writing) in the implementation of Castor,
 * difficulties encountered in serializing collections, and (in
 * summary) the inadequacy of the whole framework for the task of
 * merely marshalling objects to XML and back, Castor is being phased
 * out of the LOCKSS codebase. Newer serialization facilities are
 * based on {@link <a href="http://xstream.codehaus.org/">XStream</a>}
 * (see {@link XStreamSerializer}).</p>
 * <p>This class is provided for backwards compatibility, as part of
 * a refactoring of marshaller code to make room for XStream-based
 * marshalling. It may be deprecated in the future. New client code
 * should not use this class for serialization tasks.</p>
 * <p>It is generally <em>not safe</em> to use an instance of this
 * class for multiple unrelated serialization operations. It may be
 * possible to re-use the same instance for multiple marshalling
 * or for multiple unmarshalling operations based on the same
 * mapping.</p>
 * <p>This class is not able to enforce that an object graph is
 * serializable while carrying out a serialization task.</p>

  /*
   * IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
   *
   * This class was created in the process of refactoring all XML
   * marshalling code previously in org.lockss.util.XmlMarshaller
   * (which may no longer be around when someone next reads this).
   * The goal was to remove Castor-aware code from data structures
   * that had no business knowing about Castor and data binding
   * frameworks, and to enable phasing out Castor and phasing in
   * XStream.
   *
   * Marshalling with Castor requires mapping files, but I do not
   * know how the ones that were already in the codebase were
   * originally produced.
   *
   * If you are trying to figure out from digging back in CVS
   * history how XmlMarshaller worked, the summary is:
   *  * The basic functionality came from storeToWriter and
   *    loadFromReader.
   *  * All store() methods ended up calling
   *    store(File, Object, Mapping) and all load() methods end up
   *    calling load(File, Class, Mapping).
