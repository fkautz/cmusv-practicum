information about the project.

Obtaining Source
----------------

The latest version of this code can be obtained via CVS with

 export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/lockss
 cvs checkout lockss-daemon

A tar of the sources for the latest release can be found at 
 http://sourceforge.net/projects/lockss/

Prerequisites
-------------

- Ant (at least version 1.6.2), is used to build the system and run unit
  tests.  Download the latest version from http://ant.apache.org/ .
  Installation instructions are at http://ant.apache.org/manual/

- Junit is included in the LOCKSS source distribution, but the Ant targets
  that invoke JUnit (test-xxx) require the JUnit jar to be on Ant's
  classpath.  The easiest way to do that is to copy lib/junit.jar into
  Ant's lib directory (<ant-install-dir>/ant/lib).

To Build
--------

ant test-all		Builds the system and runs all tests
ant test-one -Dclass=org.lockss.foo.TestBar
			Builds the system and runs the tests for one class
ant -projecthelp	Lists other build options
