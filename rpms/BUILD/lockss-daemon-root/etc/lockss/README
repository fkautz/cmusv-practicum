	      Instructions for Configuring and Running LOCKSS

This is a Linux version of the LOCKSS preservation daemon, also distributed
as part of the LOCKSS Appliance (see
http://www.lockss.org/installing/installing.htm).  This installation of
LOCKSS may be less trustworthy than the appliance, depending on the security
of the underlying Linux platform.

Prerequisites:
- Public (routable) IP address
- Java 1.4 or higher

Configuration:
After installing the RPM, run /etc/locks/hostconfig as root.  You will be
asked for the following information.  Most values will default to reasonable
guesses, or to their previous value if hostconfig has previously been run.

- Fully qualified hostname (FQDN) of this machine.

- IP address of this machine.

- Initial subnet for admin UI access.
    The subnet (in CIDR, IP/MASK or X.Y.Z.* notation) that will initially
    be granted access to the web-based administrative UI.  The local host
    is implicitly allowed.

- Mail relay for this machine
    If the machine is configured to handle mail, "localhost" should work.
    Otherwise, should be an SMTP relay that will accept mail from this
    machine.

- E-mail address for administrator
    Occasional alerts may be sent to this address.

- Path to java
    Full path to java executable.

- Java switches
    Normally blank.  If set, replaces the built-in switches (see
    /etc/lockss/rundaemon).

- Configuration URL
    The URL (or local file name) from which the LOCKSS daemon will load
    extended configuration and tuning parameters.  Use the default value to
    participate in the global LOCKSS preservation community.  Use a private
    config file to create your own preservation community.  May also be a
    string of the form "-p <url1> -p <url2> ..."  to load multiple config
    files.

- Preservation group
    Used to select group-specific options in the config file.  Use the
    default value to participate in the global LOCKSS preservation
    community.

- Cache storage directories
    The full path of the directory under which LOCKSS will store
    configuration and preserved content.  (Or a semicolon-separated list of
    paths, if you have multiple disks/mount points.)  The directory must be
    writable by the lockss user.  The script will attempt to create such a
    directory if necessary, but it won't handle all cases.  (E.g., parent
    dirs that aren't searchable (execute permission) by lockss.)

- User name for web UI administration
- Password for web UI administration user admin

The script will then echo the values and ask for confirmation, store the
configuration and create any necessary cache directories.

The LOCKSS daemon can be started by running "/etc/init.d/lockss start",
which will happen automatically at the next reboot.  To further administer
the daemon, go to http://<hostname>:8081/ (or other port, if not using the
standard daemon configuration).
