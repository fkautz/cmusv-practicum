/**
 * <p>A PDF transform for PDF files of the American Physiological
 * Society.</p>
 * <h3>Overview of dynamic elements in APS PDF files</h3>
 * <p>APS PDF files have the following dynamic elements:</p>
 * <ul>
 *  <li>The modification date is when the dynamic document was
 *  generated.</li>
 *  <li>The metadata contains the modification date.</li>
 *  <li>The metadata contains an instance ID.</li>
 *  <li>The trailer contains an instance ID.</li>
 *  <li>Each page has a vertical banner with three strings forming
 *  text similar to "<code>Downloaded from physrev.physiology.org on
 *  September 14, 2006 </code>". This banner is implemented in one
 *  of two ways.</li>
 *  <li>Additionally, the first page shows the day the dynamic
 *  document was generated in a variable string like
 *  "<code>This information is current as of September 14,
 *  2006 . </code>".</li>
 * </ul>
 * <h3>Dealing with variable modification dates, instance IDs and
 * metadata</h3>
 * <p>{@link NormalizeMetadata} is used to remove the modification date,
 * erase all metadata, and replace the occurrence of the instance ID in
 * the trailer by something else.</p>
 * <h3>Dealing with the variable vertical banner</h3>
 * <p>{@link EraseVerticalBanner} and {@link ProcessEndTextObject},
 * and alternatively {@link EraseVerticalBanner2} and
 * {@link ProcessEndTextObject2}, are used to remove the vertical
 * banner text.</p>
 * <h3>Dealing with the first page's variable date string</h3>
 * <p>{@link NormalizeCurrentAsOf} and {@link ReplaceCurrentAsOf} are used
 * to remove the variable date on the first page.</p>
 * <h3>Simplified version</h3>
 * <p>Because transforms are not robust across PDF format versions,
 * this transform comes with {@link Simplified},
 * a companion transform based on
 * {@link TextScrapingDocumentTransform}.</p>
