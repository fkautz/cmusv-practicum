      LOCKSS Release Notes
      </h2>
    </center>
 <h3>Overview</h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Platform Releases:</span> OpenBSD has
a well-developed release process that produces a release every 6
months.&nbsp; We aim to do a platform release ( a "new CD") about 6
weeks after each new OpenBSD release.&nbsp; The changes to the LOCKSS
platform appliance that are included with each such release are
determined about a month before the OpenBSD release,&nbsp; when the
exact set of OpenBSD changes are clear.&nbsp; We expect that the next
such list will be generated in October 2004,&nbsp; ready for a probable
3.6 OpenBSD release in November.&nbsp; This allows 10 weeks for
development and internal pre-release testing.&nbsp; At present the only
significant user-visible candidate for the next list is supporting
machines with no floppy. There are many candidate cleanup and
performance fixes.

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Daemon Releases:</span> The LOCKSS
team has a release and test process that produces a new daemon every 6
weeks for release to and automatic download by the deployed LOCKSS
peers.&nbsp; The exact set of changes to be included in each 6-weekly
release is pretty firm 4 weeks before the release and is frozen 2 weeks
before to allow for testing.<br>
